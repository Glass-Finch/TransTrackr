Residents can self-attest to change identity documents, are covered by comprehensive anti-discrimination laws, and benefit from statutes that ban the trans-panic defense, require prisons to house people by gender identity, and bar schools from outing or excluding trans students. Still, the Attorney General documented 65 anti-trans hate-crime events in 2023, underscoring that legal progress has not eliminated safety concerns.",

The state blocks updates to gender markers on identity documents and offers no statewide non-discrimination protections. Hate-crime law omits gender identity, the “panic” defense remains legal, and prisons house trans people case-by-case, usually by birth sex. Schools must not facilitate social transition, bathrooms and sports teams are restricted by sex, and adoption agencies may refuse LGBTQ parents. Together these policies make Texas one of the most hostile states for trans residents despite ongoing community resistance.",

    "summary": "Florida enacted SB 254 in 2023, banning gender-affirming care for minors, imposing felony penalties on providers, and allowing courts to seize emergency custody of trans youth from affirming parents. Adult patients now face strict in-person and telehealth limits, and the state continues to defend its Medicaid exclusion despite a federal ruling striking it down. The DMV has halted gender-marker updates and birth-certificate changes still require a doctor’s letter, with no “X” option. Florida lacks a statewide gender-identity nondiscrimination law and offers no insurance mandate for transition care. Hate-crime statutes cover gender identity, but the trans-panic defense is still legal. HB 1521 criminalises bathroom use that differs from birth sex in public buildings, schools, and prisons, and SB 1028 bars trans girls and women from female sports teams. Expanded “Parental Rights” rules (HB 1069) effectively force schools to out trans students by requiring parental sign-off for names and pronouns. Prison housing is determined case-by-case, often defaulting to birth sex. With no shield law and policies that treat parental affirmation as potential abuse, Florida is currently one of the most hostile states for trans residents.",
